Each version can have the following:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'1.0.0' => [\r\n    'changes' => [\r\n        'this is a change',\r\n        'this is another'\r\n    ],\r\n    'requirements' => [\r\n        //.. the same as the main requirements\r\n    ],\r\n    'tasks' => [\r\n        \\LeeMason\\Larastaller\\Tasks\\AppKeyTask::class,\r\n        \\LeeMason\\Larastaller\\Tasks\\MigrateTask::class,\r\n        //.. any more tasks you need to complete for this version\r\n    ],\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the array key is the version string. This must be formatted in a way compatible with the php ```version_compare``` function.\r\n\r\n## Compatability\r\n\r\nThe Larastaller package has been developed with Laravel 5.1, i see no reason why it wouldn't work with 5.0 or even 4 but it is only tested for 5.1.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\n@todo\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### http\r\n\r\n@todo\r\n\r\n### artisan\r\n\r\nThe larastaller package comes with multiple installer commands which are listed below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp artisan installer:install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will:\r\n\r\n- Run through requirements for all versions, test them and report any errors.\r\n- Request via console questions, passwords, choices and true/false fields all of the data requested by each task\r\n- Resolve each task class and perform the tasks ```handle()``` function\r\n- If a task throws and exception, the install will cease\r\n- If all tasks complete successfully save the installation details into the ```storage_path('installation.json');``` file\r\n- Report the install as a success and exit\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp artisan installer:changes $version\r\n```\r\n\r\n```$version```` Possible values [\"latest\", \"last-x\" eg (last-5), \"version\" string eg (1.1.1), \"all\"]\r\n\r\nThis will fetch the version(s) requested and display the changes added to the version array as a list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
